                I started my programming journey at the age of 12 with C++,
                I always loved building new things and seeing these inventions
                come to life which is why I decided to pursue software engineering.
                <br></br><br></br>
                Today, I'm a software engineer who creates full-stack applications. I'm always working
                on projects to expand my skillset as well as working with people who help me grow as a software
                engineer. The entire process fascinates me from the planning stages of a project to laying the finishing
                touches. And most importantly, I'm in love with the process of learning new things.
